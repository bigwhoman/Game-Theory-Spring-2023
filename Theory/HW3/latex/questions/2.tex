  This means that there exists an element on row i column i which is \textbf{bigger than all other elements on row i} and since the game is \textbf{symmetric}, 
  this element is also \textbf{greater than all elements on column i} so we could say that this is the best response for both player 1 and player 2 and we know that in a 
  symmetric game, if $(a_i,a_i)$ is a \textbf{strict NE}, then it is also evolutionary stable strategy.\\
  So to sum things up, we showed that since this game is symmetric and by the questions hypothesis, $a_{ii}$ is a strict NE and we know that strict NE in symmetric games where both strategies are the same is an ESS.
