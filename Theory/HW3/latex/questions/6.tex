              If $V-c > \alpha V \rightarrow (protect,protect) = strict NE \rightarrow protect = ESS$\\
              We also know that in this case, the $(leave,leave)$ option would be strictly dominated so it could not be an NE, hence $leave$ is not ESS in this case.\\
              If $\alpha V -c < 0 \rightarrow (leave,leave) = strict NE \rightarrow ESS$\\
              We also know that in this case, the $(protect,protect)$ option would be strictly dominated so it could not be an NE, hence $protect$ is not ESS in this case.

              \textbf{We proved that in the first and second case, there would only exist one ESS.}\\

              First lets see protect, we could see that $(protect,protect)$ is a strict NE because : \\
              $V-c > (1-\alpha )V -c > \alpha V - c \xrightarrow[]{c> \alpha V} V-c > \alpha V \rightarrow protect = ESS$ \\
              Also leave is a strict NE because : \\
              $\alpha V < c \rightarrow \alpha V -c < 0 \rightarrow leave = ESS$ \\\\

              So we saw that protect and leave are both ESS because they are \textbf{both strict NEs}.

              \noindent
              In this state we could see that neither (protect,protect) or (leave,leave) is not a strict NE so they could not be ESS, hence we need to find the mixed NE and then find if its a mixed ESS.\\
              $U_1(protect,P) = p_1 * (V-c) + (1-p_1)(\alpha V -c )$\\
              $U_1(leave,P) = p_1 * \alpha V $\\\\
              $p_1 \alpha V = p_1 * (V-c) + (1-p_1)(\alpha V - c ) \rightarrow p_1 = \frac{\alpha V -c }{(2\alpha - 1)V}$\\\\
              Now lets see if its also ESS, to do this we should check that for every mixed strategy, $\beta$ u(NE,$\beta$) > u($\beta$,$\beta$) : \\\\
              $\frac{\alpha V -c }{(2\alpha - 1)V} * p * (V-c) + (1 - \frac{\alpha V -c }{(2\alpha - 1)V})*p*\alpha V + \frac{\alpha V -c }{(2\alpha - 1)V}*(1-p)*(\alpha V -c) > \\ p^2 * (V-c) + p*(1-p)*(\alpha V -c) + p * (1-p) * \alpha V \\
              \rightarrow True \rightarrow ESS$
          \end{latin}
