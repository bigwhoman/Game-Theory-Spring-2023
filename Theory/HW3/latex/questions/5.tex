              We know that P is the matrix of probabilities which hold the probabilities for mixed nash equilibrium, so $RP = cI \xrightarrow[]{RR^{-1}=I} P = cR^{-1}$ \\
              We know by the property of matrix inversion, a matrix could only have at best, one inverse so we know that P is unique. \\

              This equilibrium exists if R is inversable.\\

            The strategy is best response for both players due to A being symmetic, so this strategy would always be an ESS.
