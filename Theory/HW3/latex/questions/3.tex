        x & -\infty,-\infty & \circs{3},1       & 0,\circs{2}       \\
        y & 1,\circs{3}     & 0,0               & \circs{1},-\infty \\
        z & \circs{2},0     & -\infty,\circs{1} & 0,0

  As you could see, there is no pure NE.
  \\
  Now to find mixed NEs: \\
  $U_1(x,P) = -\infty * p_1 + 3 * p_2$\\\\
  $U_1(y,P) = p_1 + p_3$\\\\
  $U_1(z,P) = 2p_1 -\infty * p_2$\\\\
  We see that $\infty$ is making a problem in our equations and we cant solve them, simply because infinity is considered unknown and that is why in an infinity utility game, there is a possibility which we will not find any equilibriums.\\
  \\\\
  Now for the second part think as if we remove the profiles with $-\infty$ and randomize between the other strategies, \\
  each player now has expected of 6/6 = 1 payoff. \\
  We could also remove the profiles in which both players get 0,0 so that each players payoff would be 6/4 = 1.5 and no player would deviate.\\
  Consider this scenario that there is a third party which could draw (y,x) (z,x) (x,y) (x,z) and then recommend a strategy to each player, we know that the players won't deviate from the recommended strategy.\\
