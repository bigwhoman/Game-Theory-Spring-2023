              If each member of the board chooses its preference, clearly in the first level, Y would be removed and in the second level, X would be removed the only remaining option would be Z.\\\\

              $
                  \begin{cases}
                      A : & X > Y > Z \rightarrow X > Z \\
                      B : & Z > Y > X \rightarrow Z > X \\
                      C : & Y > Z > X \rightarrow Z > X
                  \end{cases}

            In this state, the members should be carefull because if they remove a choice it could impact the other groups.\\
            In this state each member of A would know that group B and C's members have choice X as their least favorite option, hence X would not be chosen even if it makes it to the second level. So 
            they would pick their second best option, Y knowing that it could possibly win in second level.\\
            Members of B and C also know that their best options could be a potential winner in the second level so they would vote for their first option.
