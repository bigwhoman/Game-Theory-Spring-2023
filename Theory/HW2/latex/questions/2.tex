  For this question we consider the payoff for the players, if we want the strategy to converge to a nash equilibrium,
  we should declare the overall payoffs.\\
  First off all, we should see the payoff of each player whenever in odd rounds, A,A is played and in even rounds, B,B is played.
  \\\\
  $Payoff_{p1} =0 * \beta^1 + 5 * \beta^2 + 0*\beta^3 + \cdots =  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{2i} * 5 = \frac{5\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}$\\\\
  $Payoff_{p2} =5 * \beta^1 + 0 * \beta^2 + 5*\beta^3 + \cdots = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{2i-1} * 5 = \frac{1}{\beta} * \frac{5\beta^2}{1-\beta^2} = \frac{5\beta}{1-\beta^2}$\\\\
  Now in order to get a nash equilibrium, no player should change their strategy. Now if a player wants to change their strategy from A,A to A,B or from B,B to A,B and so forth
  , their utility would be as below : \\\\
  $Payoff = 1 * \beta^1 + 1 * \beta^2 + 1*\beta^3 + \cdots =  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{i} =\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}$\\\\
  $\frac{\beta}{1-\beta} < \frac{5\beta}{1-\beta^2} \xrightarrow[]{0<\beta<1} True$\\\\
  $\frac{\beta}{1-\beta} < \frac{5\beta^2}{1-\beta^2} \rightarrow \frac{1}{4}<\beta<1$
  \\\\
  Now we know that if the payoff is discount is between 1/4 and 1, the final utility of the players would be less so no player would want to change their answers.
