              First we remove dominated strategies : \\
              for player 1, C is definatly dominated by D and by itterative domination, D would also be the dominating strategy for player 2.\\
              So the only strategy which is also the nash equilibrium is (D,D).\\

            Think of it as this way, they both have played for k-1 rounds using (C,C) as strategy, now player 1 chooses to deviate, and for n rounds after that would get 
            1 as reward. \\ Lets write the utility.
            Max utility for player 1 = $U_{P1}$ and $U'_{P1}$ = max utility after k+n+1 steps\\\\
            In case of deviation : $U_{P1} = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\delta^{i-1}*4+6*\delta^{k}+\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1}\delta^i + U'_{P1}$\\\\
            In case of no deviation : $U_{P1} = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\delta^{i-1}*4+4*\delta^{k}+4*\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1}\delta^i + U'_{P1}$\\\\
            For the player to deviate, case of deviation should have more payoff than no deviation.\\
            $
            \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\delta^{i-1}*4+6*\delta^{k}+\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1}\delta^i + U'_{P1} > \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\delta^{i-1}*4+4*\delta^{k}+4*\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1}\delta^i + U'_{P1} \rightarrow 
            \\
            2\delta^k > 3 * \sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1}\delta^i \xrightarrow[]{\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n+1}\delta^i = \frac{\delta^{k+1}(1-\delta^n)}{1-\delta}} 2\delta^k > 3 * \frac{\delta^{k+1}(1-\delta^n)}{1-\delta}
            \rightarrow 2 > 3 * \frac{\delta(1-\delta^n)}{1-\delta} \xrightarrow[]{\delta = \frac{1}{2}} \\
            2 > 3 * (1-\frac{1}{2^n}) \rightarrow \frac{1}{2^n} > \frac{1}{3} \rightarrow 3 > 2^n \rightarrow n < \log_{2}^{3} \xrightarrow[]{\text{n is natural}} n = 1 
            $ \\\\
            So the only way deviation works for player 1 is when n is equal to 1, otherwise it would not be rational for the player to deviate. \\
            So for $2 \leq n$ the strategy would be stable and the players would always play (C,C)
          \end{latin}
