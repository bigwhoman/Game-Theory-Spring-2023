        If we choose a profile in which a = (e,e,e,...), then we have nash equillibrium.\\
        The proof is that $u_i = e$ and by mathamatical proof we show that for each player, utility of derivation of this profile 
        is less that the original.\\
        We assume that there exists one player j that chooses $e^{'}$ : \\
        $\begin{cases}
            e^{'} < e & \rightarrow min_j e_j = e^{'} \rightarrow u_j = 2e ^{'} - e ^{'} < e \text{   }\otimes\\
            e^{'} > e & \rightarrow min_j e_j = e \rightarrow u_j = 2e - e^{'} < 2e - e \text{   } \otimes
        \end{cases}$
        \\
        So we see that no other player would want to change the strategy, so a = (e,e,e,...) is a nash equillibrium.
        \\
        Now we need to show that no other nash equillibrium points exist in this game.\\
        We assume that there is a equillibrium $a = (e,e,e^{'},e,...)$ which at least one player has chosen a differenct strategy $e^{'}$ and the profile is also a nash equillibrium.\\
        $\begin{cases}
            e^{'} < e & \rightarrow min_j e_j = e^{'} \rightarrow u_j = 2e ^{'} - e ^{'} < e \text{   } \\
            e^{'} > e & \rightarrow min_j e_j = e \rightarrow u_j = 2e - e^{'} < 2e - e \text{   } 
        \end{cases}  \Rightarrow $ player with strategy $e^{'}$ will choose strategy e to get better utility hence the original point $a = (e,e,e^{'},e,...)$ was not a nash equillibrium.
