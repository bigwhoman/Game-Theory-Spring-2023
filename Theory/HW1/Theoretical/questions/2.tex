    We could see that for player 2, if a2 >= 1, then the payoff would be 
    less or equal to a2 = 0, so a2 >= 1 strategies are weakly dominated by a2 = 0 strategy, hence we should cut them off. \\
    Now that we know that player 2 strategies are limited to only $0 \leq a_2 \leq 1$ , we should find the payoffs : \\ 
    If player 1 plays $x_1$ , the best possible move for player 2 would be $-\frac{a_1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$ and if player 2 plays $a_2$,
    the best possible move for player 1 would be $\frac{a_2}{2}$. \\ 
    If player 2 starts off with 1, player 1 would choose $\frac{1}{2}$ and if player 1 chooses $\frac{1}{2}$, player 2 would choose $\frac{1}{4}$ and so on ... \\
    $a_2 = 1 \Rightarrow a_1 = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow a_2 = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow a_1 = \frac{1}{8} \Rightarrow ...$ \\ 
    If you get the limit of this equation you will see that $x_1 \rightarrow 0.2 , x_2 \rightarrow 0.4$
